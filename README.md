# Carbon Capture Calculator
This is Python code to calculate the amount of CO2 captured from a DAC (Direct Air Capture) machine, specifically a moisture swing system. This code plays nicely with some other code I wrote: https://github.com/charlienicholson3/SCD30-Code/tree/main. To learn more about how to make your own DAC machine, visit my website: https://nicholsonlabs.gitbook.io/labs/carbon-capture.

There are two different files for the carbon capture calculator, each with its own respective guides. The ```co2CalculatorPump.py``` file calculates CO2 captured from the air going through the capture membrane and measures the CO2 difference between the inlet and outlet, and then does some math to find out the CO2 captured. On the other hand, ```co2CalculatorBox.py``` calculates captured CO2 from either the increase or decrease of CO2 in a closed environment, like a box. Both of these can be configured to measure the regeneration of the sorbent and the capture of CO2, though ```co2CalculatorBox.py``` is already configured to work in a regeneration style, and ```co2CalculatorPump.py``` is configured to work in capture style. To use my code, follow the guides.
